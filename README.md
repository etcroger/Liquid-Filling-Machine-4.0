# Liquid-Filling-Machine-4.0
The project "LIQUID BOTTLING APPLIED TO INDUSTRY 4.0" aims to apply some of the pillars of industry 4.0 in an industrial process, which in our prototype is the liquid filling process. The project has the following components: -ESP32 controlling the process, performing sensor readings and activating its actuators. - HMI - is being simulated on AVEVA Edge. - Development of an application to monitor reservoir levels, product quantity and traceability of each product with its characteristics in real time. - 3D simulation of the process. - Cloud database to store all information collected in the field.
